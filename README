This is a module to manage pacemaker-clusters and services from within puppet.

== Setup the cluster and services ==

== Add module for service ==

If you want to set-up a service, you will want to add a pacemaker::service::servicename class.
Best choice to do this, is the modules/pacemaker/manifests/services/ directory.
The service definition should have a parameter for the cluster-name and it should include the pacemaker::service class in the following manner:

class pacemaker::service::foobar ( $clustername = 'default' ) {
    pacemaker::service { "foobar":
        clustername => $clustername,
        servicename => 'foobar',
        require => [Package["foobar","foobaz"]]
    }
(...)

The require should include all the packages and file you are using within the pacemaker::service::servicename class.

== Add cluster ==

A cluster consists of three files. The configuration of the cluster messaging (corosync.conf), 
an authentication key for the encrypted and authenticated communication within the cluster (authkey)
and some general configuration of your cluster like quorum configuration. (crm.cib)

All of these files should come into a directory within the files directory called cluster-clustername. That's it.

You can include them by setting the $clustername in the pacemaker::service::servicename class to your directories clustername.

That's it.
